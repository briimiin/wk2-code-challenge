JavaScript Functions
This repository contains JavaScript functions for three tasks:

# Swap Case
Accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, inputting 'The Quick Brown Fox' would output 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

# number array
Accepts two numbers and generates an array of numbers between them, inclusive. For example, inputting 4 and 7 would output [4, 5, 6, 7], while inputting -4 and 7 would output [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

# prime numbers 
Accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. It accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example, inputting [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] would output [2, 3, 5, 7].
